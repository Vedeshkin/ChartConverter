# ChartConverter
After short discuss with Pavel Kabanov we go conclusion that we need new chart converter.
**Goals:**
Make chart converting from FXCM to SCS seamless and easy via web UI.
Only thing that user will have to do is upload FXCM chart file via web UI chart and provide symbol to map.
`E.G.NGAS->NATGAS.`

Chart converter should be able to detect type of chart(daily/minute) and automatically convert it to SCS format.
Another goal is to make this converter easily maintainable and ready-to-change.
Personal goal is to get a new expirence with JAVA technologies such as Servlets,Apache COMMONS,Log4j,Maven,Jetty,Tomcat.

This Branch is for testing CONSOLE Version only.
